<h1> A Small Detour </h1>

At my work, I learned a new methodology called Sprint Planning. At the end of a Sprint Review and Retrospective begins a new sprint. It is kicked off with a Sprint Planning. 
After my new sprint at work began did I only start adding new user stories and issues - which was wrong. It should be done a day ago before Sprint Planning initiated so that everyone on the team knows the work focus, expectation, and pick from and assess the same pool of tasks.
<br><br>

<i>Sprint Planning</i> is like filling your plate in a buffet.
You won't fill your plate with everything that the buffet offers, just deal with what you can fit on your plate at the time. 
If you want more of the other food, you know you can come back to them later.
Similar to projects, you only pick tasks that are most reasonable for the time period. Only take a reasonable quantity that you can finish up before you start a new plate.

I am not going to necessarily Agile my life haha but these are good little lessons!
Retrospectives is something I'd love to keep, it's healthy to step back and reflect before charging. So catch my retro this July 1st!
<br><br>

I finally broke my Github commit streak. I'm so happy. As much as I appreciated that Github had been a place to channel my emptiness and burning ardour, I have hit a point where I am wondering what am I even obsessively keeping up commits for. What cause? 
My main goals with qtrlex and Casually CSS are finished. It's a good time to rest. Just sit back, plan, sketch, enjoy life without worrying bringing my laptop to a camp.

I found a post that says giving 1.01 each day will yield you 37.78 in a year (1.01 ^ 365 = 37.78). That's better than 1.00 ^ 365 which is 1.00. Takeaway is that small consistent efforts matter. True to a degree. But honestly? Don't expect a 365 day streak from a human. Especially from woman *gals ifykyk* 
I went out to leisurely walk under 40 degrees. I am like haha, look at everyone hiding in their houses while I am outside, fancy myself roasted this fine day. Ahhh, just getting my exercise. Heat's not stopping me. So indomitable, sooo strong. 
Wake up feeling very sick. Get coma-bathroom cycles in high frequencies. I should be working. Yay! Grindset my face, your foot, the kids.
<br><br>

We think consistent looks like this.

But consistent can also look like this. Holes in between, but still progressing, still consistent. Falling off consistency is all good and normal too. These are screenshots from my Bible Memory app. Months before these bars, there was only desolation, tumbleweeds, crickets, den of dragons, satyrs dancing. Nada.

So yup, I am stepping back needfully to reassess what the following month will look like. I decided that there is going to be a shift in my summer priorities and goals.
Dude, that sounds so much like Sprint Planning. Yea haha, I guess that's the deal!
